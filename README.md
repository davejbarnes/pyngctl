# pyngctl
Rewrite of bash script ngctl

This is my latest project - learning Python by solving a problem I already solved in a bash script

Yes, I know argparse exists.  I'm learning by doing something familiar in a new language.

I'm trying to write "idiomatic" Python with varying degrees of success :)
